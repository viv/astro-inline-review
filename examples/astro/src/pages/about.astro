    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p>
      This is a second page for testing multi-page annotations. Annotations
      created here should appear under the <code>/about</code> URL in the
      panel, separate from annotations on the home page.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that reviewing rendered content should happen in the browser,
      not in source code diffs. Select this text to create an annotation that
      is scoped to the about page.
    </p>

    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <div class="team-member">
      <h3>Alice — Lead Designer</h3>
      <p>Alice has been designing user interfaces for over a decade. She
      focuses on accessibility and clarity. Alt+click this card to annotate
      the team member element.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="team-member">
      <h3>Bob — Engineer</h3>
      <p>Bob writes the code that makes things work. He believes in shipping
      small increments and testing thoroughly.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      Reach out at <strong>hello@example.com</strong> or find us on the usual
      channels. This paragraph provides more text to select and annotate on
      the about page.
